# Code book

This codebook sums up the resulting variables in the final tidy data set.

As identifiers, there are the columns "subject" (ID of each individual submitted to the tests) and "activity" (the activity or exercise realized when the measurements were taken).

Also there are the measurements (mean and standard deviation) for the following features in the X, Y and Z directions:
- tBodyAcc-XYZ;
- tGravityAcc-XYZ;
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ;
- tBodyGyro-XYZ;
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ;
- fBodyAcc-XYZ;
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ;
- fBodyGyro-XYZ
- fBodyGyroJerkMag.

And for their absolute magnitude:
- tBodyAccMag;
- tGravityAccMag;
- tBodyAccJerkMag;
- tBodyGyroMag;
- tBodyGyroJerkMag;
- fBodyAccMag;
- fBodyAccJerkMag;
- fBodyGyroMag;
- fBodyGyroJerkMag.

Activity labels:
- 1: subject was walking during the test, labelled "WALKING";
- 2: subject was walking up a staircase during the test, labelled "WALKING_UPSTAIRS";
- 3: subject was walking down a staircase during the test, labelled "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS";
- 4: subject was sitting during the test, labelled "SITTING";
- 5: subject was standing during the test, labelled "STANDING";
- 6: subject was laying down during the test, labelled "LAYING".
